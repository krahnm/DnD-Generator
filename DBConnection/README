***************************
To use this set of classes:
***************************


1.  Edit DBDetails.java to add your username and your student number
2. Your student number is your database password.  Do not use your regular password.

3. Compile all the java classes with javac *.java

4. Run the database setup program
   java -cp mysql-connector-java-8.0.13.jar SetUpDBase

   You must run the setup program before you try to add records to the database because it sets up the tables.  You only need to run it when you wish to start over with a brand new database.

5. Run the ConnectionDemo program for an example of what kinds of things you can do with the Connection class.

6. To use it in your assignment you will need to DBDetails.java, DBMonster.java and DBConnection.java with your assignment. 
 	Please leave your connection details in the DBDetails.java file so we can run it with your database.

7. Put the mysql jar file in the lib/ folder and edit the ant build file to include that jar in the runme command (and the building commands)

8.  Don't submit the ConnectionDemo class.  It is just to help you understand what the classes do.

You may edit these classes in any way you wish.  You may add fields to the database tables,  add methods, change methods, etc.  Make sure that your Monster representation includes name and upper and lower bound for numbers of monsters.  You can add any information you wish.

I recommend that you bootstrap your database by loading a csv file of monster data.
